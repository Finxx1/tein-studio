The editor provides the necessary tools for modders to unpack the game's resources, modify and create new levels, and modify the world map, all with an easy-to-use interface.

## Building

For those interested in contributing to the editor's development, building is as simple as running the `build\win32\build.bat` script. Visual Studio is required in order
for this script to work correctly. All of the code dependencies and external third party libraries have been included within this repository, so there is no need to fetch
them. To modify build parameters and flags open the `build\win32\config.bat` script and tweak the values to change how the editor is built.
